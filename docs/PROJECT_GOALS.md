# Project goals

Number 1 current goal of this project is to become an open source version of Majesty, the Fantasy Kingdom Sim. Lets break that down a little more.

NOTE: Pawn is just the baseclass for any unit in the game. a wolf is a pawn, a hero is a pawn, a dragon is a pawn. You, hopefully, are not a pawn.

Needed Majesty Features:
1. Pawns
	1. ~~Pawns can move with pathfinding~~
	2. ~~Pawns can use actions to interact with the world~~
	3. Pawns have unique personalities depending on the type of hero/ unit they are. This is currenlty partialy completed through the use of pawn goals and will be marked as completed when there are advanced enough goals to capture all the behaviors in Majesty
	4. ~~Pawns can loot equipment from chests~~
	5. Pawns can learn new spells and abilites
	6. Pawns can level up, which increases their stats
	7. There are pawn meshes for all the heros in majesty
	8. there are pawn meshes for all the monsters in majesty
2. Buildings
	1. Buildings should exist
		1. Blacksmith -- upgrades gear
		2. Inn -- shelters heros
		3. Library -- teaches heros spells
		4. Monster lairs -- spawns monsters
		5. Many more I am not listing here
	3. Buildings have health and can be destroyed
3. Player gameplay
	1. The player has curreny of some kind he can use to hire heroes
	2. The player can place buildings, and the player loses money when he does so
	3. The player can place bounties
		1. Scouting bounties to explore the unexplored
		2. Attack bounties to kill a particular target

The above list is non-exhaustive and should NOT be seen as a limiting factor. If someone wants to implement monsters/buildings/behaviors that do not exist in majesty, be my guest

Going beyond majesty, some goals would be:

1. Pawns will join together in 'adventuring parties'
2. Classes are removed alltogether. Instead of Warrior/Rogue/Wizzard etc there is one type of hero, and that hero may choose to specialize or become what that hero wishes (or what the player influences that hero to be). This is a rather complex goals that needs a lot of explaination. A lengthy document will be written when this game is closer to emulating all Majesty features
3. Hitpoints are done away with. Instead a damage system similar to RimWorld's damage system is used.
4. When the initial map is cleared, the game does not end! Instead the player can send his heroes out to help other villages and interact wit other kingdoms
5. Modding/Module support. I think module is more accurate. Think of how Battle for Wesnoth handles addons. If someone wants to reimagine into a sci-fi setting, they should be able to. Much, much more discussion needs to happen around this feature before a concrete idea of what this looks like will form.
