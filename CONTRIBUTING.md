# Contribute
do it and you are cool!

### Guidelines
I am sure this will populate really fast once There are other contributors, but for now all I can say is this:

In general, greatly favor composition over inheritence. Any class that is referenced in more than 3 files should have an interface.

### Additional help
I certainly understand that this project does not have perfect documentation, if you want any help please join the development discord here https://discord.gg/RcvAtQj268 and message me (Sunshine dev) directly
